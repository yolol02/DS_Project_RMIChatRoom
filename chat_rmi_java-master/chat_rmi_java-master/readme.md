# CHAT JAVA RMI


#### today I would like to show my program, which was programmed by the java language by using the technique RMI (Remote Method Invocation)

## this program can do:
- a private or public chat between two or more clients, who are identified by a username.
- the client can choose who the message will transfer to.
- every 20s list of connected clients to update.
- the administrator can block, unblock, delete client in chat.
- sending files (text, binary) between the clients.

## Preview:
